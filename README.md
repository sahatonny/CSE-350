## Structure Of The Project

- Each prediction page is conneceted with a Machine Learning Model which uses Random Forest Classifier to predict the results.
- Also we have used different datasets to train the model for each prediction.
- We can land into each prediction site of the web app from the options in the Navigation Menu.


- Each prediction is done with the help of some features which will be taken as input from the user.
- The most relevant features are taken into consideration for prediction also these features can be found out with simple tests or analysis without visiting any doctor.
- So the individual can get a broad overview of their health condition.

## The features taken into consideration

| Disorders | Features |
| - | - |
| Anxiety | Panic Attack , Heart Rate , Breathing Rate |
| Depression | Anxiety Level, Sadness Level, Insomnia Level, Emptiness Level  |
| Suicide | Self-harm Level, Anxiety Level, Depression Level |
| Bipolar |  Depression Level, Energy Level, Self-harm Level |
| Eating Disorder | Meal Skip, Insomnia Level, Self-harm Probability |
| PTSD | Insomnia Level, Anxiety Level, Self-harm Level | 


## Deployment Of The Project

After the modeling part the model is deployed using Streamlit library on Streamlit Share so that the app is available for usage for everyone.
